# FlappyBird Remake Using PyGame 🎮

- Here I have recreated the mobile app 'Flappy Bird' using python.  
- Desgined to mimic the app using google images   
- I am using the pygame library for the games functionality.  
- I constructed the game in stages, started by building the back and working foward. 

# When ran the app will run as such 🏃‍♂️
